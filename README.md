# Joel Oscarsson

I am an aspiring student who strive to learn as much as possible about AI and Machine learning. To do this i have started my educational journey at the school IT-HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg. 

I have previously worked at Volvo as an Operator and decided that after many good experiences from my work now shift my focus towards programming, mathematics and a lot of other different subjects regarding technology. This is something that i've always wanted to do.
